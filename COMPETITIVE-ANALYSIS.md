## Gap Analysis: Where's the Opportunity?

| Competitor | Gap / Weakness |
|------------|----------------|
| PlanCheckPro | Free = limited revenue model. New, unproven. |
| Blitz AI | Government only. Complex sales cycle. |
| CodeComply | No FL-specific focus. Enterprise pricing. |
| CivCheck | Government focus. Enterprise suite. |
| GreenLite | Service-heavy = expensive for small firms. |

**THE OPPORTUNITY:**
- **Simple, affordable tool for PRIVATE inspection companies**
- **Florida-specific** (FBC + local amendments)
- **Residential focus** (not trying to do commercial/industrial)
- **Private provider friendly** (per new FL statute)
- **Transparent pricing** (not enterprise sales)
